## Behavioral Analysis and Risk Assessment of Two-Wheeler Drivers

<p>With the growing popularity of two-wheelers in urban and rural areas, it is imperative to
enhance road safety and reduce the alarming rate of accidents involving two-wheeler riders.
This study combines behavioral analysis, data collection, and risk assessment to provide
insights that can be leveraged for developing effective road safety strategies.The
"Behavioral Analysis of Two-Wheeler Drivers" project aims understand the behavior of
driving patterns of individuals operating two-wheeled vehicles, such as motorcycles and
scooters.</p>
